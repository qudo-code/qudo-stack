# Qudo Stack
This is a monorepo including tools and patterns I like to use for new projects.

- [Server](./apps/server) - A server app built with Elysia.
- [DB](./packages/db) - Mange DB with Drizzle
- [Docker](./packages/docker) - Docker compose for local development that includes postgres, and Upstash Redis.
